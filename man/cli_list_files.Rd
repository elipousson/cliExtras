\usage{
cli_list_files(
  path = NULL,
  files = NULL,
  pattern = NULL,
  text = NULL,
  bullet = "*",
  n_show = 10,
  include_dirs = TRUE,
  return_list = FALSE,
  .envir = current_env(),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{a character vector of full path names; the default
    corresponds to the working directory, \code{\link[base]{getwd}()}.  Tilde
    expansion (see \code{\link[base]{path.expand}}) is performed.  Missing
    values will be ignored.  Elements with a marked encoding will
    be converted to the native encoding (and if that fails, considered
    non-existent).}

\item{files}{List to file names to display. Ignored if path is provided. If
path is a vector of existing files, path is used as files and path is
treated as \code{NULL}.}

\item{pattern}{an optional \link[base]{regular expression}.  Only file names
    which match the regular expression will be returned.}

\item{text}{Passed to \code{\link[cli:cli_alert]{cli::cli_alert_info()}}. If \code{NULL} (default), text
appears reporting the number of files/folders found at the path (if path
provided).}

\item{bullet}{Character defining style to use list of file names.}

\item{n_show}{Number of file names to show in list. The remaining number of
files n_show are noted at the end of the list but the file names are not
displayed. Defaults to 10.}

\item{include_dirs}{If \code{TRUE}, include directories in listed files. Defaults
to \code{FALSE}. Passed to the include.dirs parameter of \code{\link[base:list.files]{base::list.files()}} if
path is a directory.}

\item{return_list}{If \code{TRUE}, return the list of files after displaying the
cli message. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{.envir}{Passed to \code{\link[cli:cli_abort]{cli::cli_inform()}}. Defaults to
\code{\link[rlang:stack]{rlang::current_env()}} rather than \code{\link[=parent.frame]{parent.frame()}} to support evaluation
of default message that includes the number of files found at the path.}

\item{...}{
  Arguments passed on to \code{\link[base:list.files]{base::list.files}}
  \describe{
    \item{\code{all.files}}{a logical value.  If \code{FALSE}, only the
    names of visible files are returned (following Unix-style visibility,
    that is files whose name does not start with a dot).  If \code{TRUE},
    all file names will be returned.}
    \item{\code{full.names}}{a logical value.  If \code{TRUE}, the directory
    path is prepended to the file names to give a relative file path.
    If \code{FALSE}, the file names (rather than paths) are returned.}
    \item{\code{recursive}}{logical.  Should the listing recurse into directories?}
    \item{\code{ignore.case}}{logical.  Should pattern-matching be case-insensitive?}
    \item{\code{include.dirs}}{logical.  Should subdirectory names be included in
    recursive listings?  (They always are in non-recursive ones).}
    \item{\code{no..}}{logical.  Should both \code{"."} and \code{".."} be excluded
    also from non-recursive listings?}
